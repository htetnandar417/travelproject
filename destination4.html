		<h2>Kyaikhtiyo – Golden Rock</h2>
		<p>The Golden Rock of Kyaikhtiyo is one of the most revered pilgrimage sites for Myanmar Buddhists. The gold-covered boulder is said to maintain its balance thanks to a single hair of the Buddha enshrined inside the pagoda. The rock and the pagoda are at the top of Mt. Kyaiktiyo.To reach the top of the mountain, one can either make a 13-kilometer climb (allow about seven hours) or take an open truck with other pilgrims along a steep and winding road to a so-called middle camp. From there, all visitors have to walk up the remaining 4 kilometers (500 meters in altitude) on a steep track.</p>

		<p>An easy alternative for those who can’t manage the way on foot is to rent a sedan chair, which is carried by four porters to the top. You can also explore by hiking from Kinpun and the walk is mostly covered by the jungle canopy and gives the chance to see some lovely views and stupas along the way. Once arrived at the pagoda expect spectacular views, particularly at sunrise or sunset. The whole site has a magic charisma and is a famous site for meditation.</p>
